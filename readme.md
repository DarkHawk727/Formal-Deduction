# Formal Deduction

This is a Python program to allow me to perform some operations with propositional and first-order logic. It let's me define arbitrary propositions either programatically or through a plaintext representation. It can then create a truth table and determine its satisfiability.

## Current Features

- Define arbitrary statements in propositional language either programatically.
- Lets you evaluate statements with a valuation
- Create a truth table for said proposition, determine satisfiability, check if two propositions are logically equivalent.
- Generate the Disjunctive Normal Form of a proposition by truth table.

## Planned Features

- Parse expressions from a plaintext representation using a recursive descent parser.
- Show intermediate results in truth tables.
- Define rules to transform expressions like $((A\to B)\equiv ((\neg A)\vee B)$
- Resolution using DPP
