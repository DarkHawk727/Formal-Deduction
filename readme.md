# Formal Deduction

This is a Python program to allow me to perform some operations with propositional and first-order logic. It let's me define arbitrary propositions either programatically or through a plaintext representation. It can then create a truth table and determine its satisfiability.

## Current Features

- Define arbitrary statements in propositional language either programatically or in plaintext through the commandline.
- Lets you evaluate statements with a valuation
- Create a truth table for said proposition, determine satisfiability, check if two propositions are logically equivalent.
- Generate the Disjunctive Normal Form of a proposition by truth table.

## Planned Features

- Define rules to transform expressions like (A → B) ≡ ((¬A) ∨ B)
- Resolution using DPP
